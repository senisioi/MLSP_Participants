The little one's cradle stood by my bed at night; it was hardly allowed to stir, when I was awake; soon I had to water it, soon lay it down to me; soon, if it did not keep quiet, get up from bed and prance up and down in the room, and stand at the washing trough early in the day; then at the market and at the hearth, and on and on as today so tomorrow.	away

The student Anselmus (no one else was the young man), although he did not understand the woman's strange words, felt an involuntary horror, and he quickened his steps even more to escape the curious crowd's gaze.	inspired
The women forgave the well-educated face, whose expression heightened the fervor of his inner fierceness, as well as the youth's sturdy stature, all awkwardness and his out-of-fashion suit.	Growth
All the marvelous things he had seen had vanished from his memory, and he only remembered that he had talked all sorts of crazy things out loud under the elder tree, which was all the more appalling to him as he had always had an inner loathing of all self-talk.	Disgust
The student Anselmus was quite happy to accept this, because he believed that he could escape the evil fate that was now befalling him.	escape
But then, as he gazed wistfully into the water to see if the blissful eyes would not peer out of the flood, he realized that the glow came only from the lighted windows of the nearby houses.	preserved
But it did the student Anselmus good to be taken care of in the most distressing situation of being thought drunk or insane, and although it had become quite dark, he thought he noticed for the first time how Veronica had quite beautiful dark blue eyes, but without the wonderful pair of eyes he had seen in the elder tree coming to his mind.	dark
As usual, music was played after the frugal meal; the student Anselmus had to sit down at the piano, and Veronika let her bright, clear voice be heard.	Meal
The student Anselmus was full of heartfelt joy at the Registrar Heerbrand's request; for not only did he write neatly and draw with a pen, it was also his true passion to copy with painstaking calligraphic effort; he therefore thanked his patrons in the most obliging terms and promised not to miss the morning lunch hour.	miss
At last the dragon, swinging himself up and down, caught the creature that had sprouted from the lily, carried it up the hill and encircled it with his wing; there it was the lily again, but the lingering thought tore its innermost being apart, and the love for the youth Phosphorus was a piercing misery, before which the little flowers that had otherwise enjoyed its gaze withered and died, breathed upon by poisonous vapors.

For the second time, those present burst out laughing, but the student Anselmus felt very uneasy, and he could hardly look into the serious eyes of Archivist Lindhorst without trembling inwardly in a way he himself could not understand.	incomprehensible
You may think what you like of me," said the student Anselmus, "you may think me a fool or not - enough! - At the door knocker, the wicked face of the witch of the Black Gate grinned at me; I'd rather not talk about what happened afterwards, but if I had woken up from my faint and seen the cursed apple woman in front of me (for no one else was the old woman who was busy with me), I would have been struck by the blow immediately, or I would have gone mad.

Anselmus walked confidently behind the archivist; they came out of the corridor into a hall, or rather into a magnificent greenhouse, for from both sides up to the ceiling were all kinds of rare and wonderful flowers, even large trees with strangely shaped leaves and blossoms.	rather
At table, the archivist Lindhorst was in a particularly cheerful mood; he asked about the student Anselmus' friends, the rector Paulmann and the registrar Heerbrand, and knew a lot of amusing things to say about the latter in particular.	Delightful
It seemed to Anselmus as if he were so completely embraced and entwined by the fair, lovely figure that he could only move and move with her, and as if it were only the beat of her pulse that trembled through his fibers and nerves; he listened to her every word, which resounded into his innermost being and ignited the bliss of heaven in him like a shining ray.

He approached; touched by his glowing breath, the lily opened its leaves, and he saw the lily's daughter, the green snake, slumbering in the chalice.	slumbered
The enraged prince of spirits seized the salamander in a rage and said: 'Your fire has died out - your flames are extinguished, your rays have gone blind - sink down to the earth spirits, who may tease and taunt you and hold you captive until the fire material reignites and shines up with you as a new being from the earth.	scoff

Have I not only myself to blame for my misery, ah! have I not sinned against you, fair, beloved Serpentina? - Have I not harbored vile doubts against you?	disdainful
"Alas," sighed the student, "they never saw the fair Serpentina, they do not know what freedom and life in faith and love are, therefore they do not feel the pressure of the prison into which the salamander banished them because of their foolishness, their wickedness, but I, unfortunate one, will perish in shame and misery if she, whom I love so unspeakably, does not save me."

The vision in which I now saw Anselmus in the flesh on his manor in Atlantis was probably due to the arts of the Salamander, and it was wonderful that, when everything had faded away as if in a fog, I found it written down quite neatly and apparently by myself on the paper lying on the violet table.	apparent
Oh, happy Anselmus, who threw off the burden of everyday life, who stirred your wings in love with the fair Serpentina and now lives in bliss and joy on your manor in Atlantis!	stirred
But poor me! - soon - indeed, in a few minutes I shall be transported even from this beautiful hall, which is far from being a manor in Atlantis, to my little attic room, and the miseries of a needy life will occupy my mind, and my gaze will be enveloped by a thousand calamities as by a thick fog, so that I shall probably never see the lily.	look

After great euphoria in the middle of 1958, it became apparent at the end of the year that the expected increase in production in the agricultural sector would not take place to a sufficient extent and that a major breakthrough in this area would not be possible.	Breakthrough

Organizationally, it was decided that the unit of account for the peasants' services would be taken away from the people's communes and transferred to the work brigades below them, in order to shift responsibility back to the grassroots of the peasants in the hope that this would better prevent excesses of the people's communes.

As the reports of famine became more frequent, but the party and state leadership were unable to ascertain whether these were isolated incidents or whether the famine was more widespread, it was decided at the end of 1960 that leading politicians such as Deng Xiaoping, Zhou Enlai, Peng Zhen, Li Xiannian, Liu Shaoqi and Mao should travel the country for several weeks, with as few followers as possible, to see for themselves.

Both in a draft of the Wealth of Nations and in the Wealth of Nations itself, Smith states that in modern society property is unequally distributed, that property income is often based on the labor of others and that the state protects these conditions; but Smith resolutely counters this with the advantages: thanks to the division of labor, the standard of living of even the lowest classes is rising and real wages are higher than in earlier times, which preceded private ownership of land and the accumulation of capital, so that the worker owned the entire product of his labor.	decidedly
After all, the capitalist mode of production and its imperative of profit maximization tend to undermine their own foundations, nature and the worker, by exhausting both prematurely if they are not prevented from doing so.	undermine
An entrepreneur who is the first to introduce an innovation with which he can, for example, produce more cheaply than his competitors, can sell at the market price in order to achieve an entrepreneurial profit; however, this profit will be contested again: on the one hand, by imitators who eliminate his monopoly position and, on the other hand, by increased costs of the corresponding production factors, as the demand for them increases.	cancel

I had grown old enough to realize that the Sandman and his nest of children in the crescent, as the waiting-woman had told me, could not be quite true; but the Sandman remained a dreadful spectre to me, and horror - horror - seized me when I heard him not only come up the stairs, but also violently tear open my father's parlor door and enter.	Horror
When I saw this Coppelius, it rose horribly and dreadfully in my soul that no one else but he could be the Sandman, but the Sandman was no longer the bogeyman from the old wives' tale, who brings children's eyes to the owl's nest in the crescent moon - no! - an ugly ghostly fiend, who brings misery - misery - temporal, eternal ruin wherever he intervenes.

The uncanny goings-on with your father at night were probably nothing other than that they were both secretly conducting alchemical experiments, with which your mother could not be satisfied, since a great deal of money was certainly being squandered in vain and on top of that, as is always the case with such laboratory assistants, your father's mind was completely filled with the deceptive urge for high wisdom and was turned away from the family.	averted

I am very unhappy that Clara vomited and read the letter to you the other day, admittedly due to my absent-mindedness.	Absentmindedness
Indeed, one should not believe that the spirit that shines out of such bright, smiling child's eyes, often like a sweet, sweet dream, could distinguish so intelligently, so magisterially.	distinguish
The disgruntlement that (I must confess) wanted to master me after the fatal letter of understanding will then be gone.	master
Clara was therefore scolded by many as cold, unfeeling, prosaic; but others, who had a clear understanding of life, loved the cozy, understanding, childlike girl immensely, but none so much as Nathanael, who moved vigorously and cheerfully in science and art.	Cozy
Nathanael, quite enraged that Clara was only stating the existence of the demon in his own mind, then wanted to come forward with the whole mystical doctrine of devils and horrible powers, but Clara broke it off in frustration by interposing something indifferent, to Nathanael's no small annoyance.	weary
Soon, however, the whole thing seemed to him to be nothing more than a very successful poem, and it seemed to him as if Clara's cold mind must be inflamed by it, although he did not think clearly what Clara was inflamed for, and what it should actually lead to, to frighten her with the horrible images that prophesied a terrible fate that would destroy her love.	prophesied
It struck him at last that Olimpia often sat for hours at a small table in the same position in which he had once discovered her through the glass door, without any occupation, and that she seemed to be gazing steadfastly at him; he had to confess to himself, too, that he had never seen a more beautiful growth; but, Clara at heart, he remained most indifferent to the stiff, rigid Olimpia, and only now and then glanced fleetingly over his compendium at the beautiful statue, that was all.	sometimes
The artificial roulades seemed to Nathanael the heavenly exultation of a mind transfigured in love, and when at last, after the cadenza, the long trillo rang out quite resoundingly through the hall, he suddenly could no longer hold himself, as if seized by glowing arms, and had to cry out loudly in pain and delight: "Olimpia!"	barked
Although the professor had done his utmost to appear splendid, the merry heads knew how to tell of all sorts of unseemly and strange things that had happened, and they were particularly fond of the dead-eyed, mute Olimpia, who, regardless of her beautiful appearance, was accused of total stupor and the reason why Spalanzani had kept her hidden for so long.	Unseemly
Nathanael heard this not without inward wrath, but he kept silent; for, he thought, would it be worth while to prove to these fellows that it was their own dullness that prevented them from recognizing Olimpia's deep and glorious mind?	Dullness

And could I but declare this coincidence, which once more, before all my hope vanishes for ever, gives me once more the happiness of seeing and speaking to you; could I but declare this coincidence to be the hint of favorable fortune - the most wonderful postponement of my final condemnation, so that I may once more implore your mercy: I will yet - do not tremble, my lady - depend solely on your gaze.
